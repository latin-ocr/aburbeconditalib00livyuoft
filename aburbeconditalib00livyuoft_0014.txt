history should not be in a very striking manner3 and . . . the
books of Livy, which we have, relate to a time so uninteresting,

naturalness had disappeared from style, and nothing could bc
said in a plain way. But although the tendency towards this
had begun in Livy's day. it had not yet carried men’s taste
