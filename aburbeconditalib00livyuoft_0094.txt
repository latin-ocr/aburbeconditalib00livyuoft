AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. lX. 9

without a preposition after a verb of motion. saneta agrees
with the nearer noun ; cf. 8 ξ 5.
ξ 5. an ε i. e. if you dispute that rule (that nothing can bind the

nation which the nation has not sanctioned). expresserunt
nobis: together. coegissent . . . diceretis: the difference
in tense must be observed3 cf. 8 ξ 15. templa, delubra:

the former are sacred spaces, whether those selected in the
heavens by the augurs for taking auspices, or those permanently
marked out on earth (and osten built upon) sor the worship of the
gods3 the latter are places of purification, where religious impurity
was washed away (de-flavo).

§6- quid tandem: sc. diceretis. N otice the sense of landem
with an interrogative. relicturum: without esse; cf. 4 ξ 3.
meliora: sc. duint or denl. inquis: sor the imaginary
second person cf. 1 ξ 7.

ξ 7. rerum, ‘the conditions ' ; cf. 6 ξ 2. illud: as often,
preparing the way for a following clause. refer-t: perhaps in
origin = ‘ it tends (fert) with interest (advantageous or disadvanta-
geous),’ where re will be an instrumental or sociative case (as in
ἀπώλετο ἡ ναῦς αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσι). It is always impersonal and is
followed only by an indirect question or, as here, by one in
apposition to a neuter pronoun subject.

§8. quibus . . . coegerunt: Latin rarely expresses a second
relative (as if here we had quz'); generally the proper part of z's
is inserted; here it is understood. English as a rule is more

logicglly regular in this matter, ‘ who were not satisfied . . . but com-
pe§e9.⁶ nee . . . quaesiverit = el ne . . . quaes. ; cf. 1 1 ξ 13.

This form of prohibition in the second person has a peremptory
tone, and is accordingly very rare ; but in Greek, where it is called
the aorist subjunctive, it is regular. quid = ‘why ’. spopon-
derim: aorist subjunctive, its own tense unaffected‚ since qutie-
siverz'l is a primary tense, yet perhaps makes esset historic, if esses
expresses a general rule. possibly, like possem, it refers only to
the time of the compact. id: although belonging only to this
clause is thrown forward sor emphasis before nec; cf. 1 ξ 9.

ξ 11. nee . . . et: nec does not connect probably; cf. 4 ξ 8.
male partam, ⁴ ill-got,’ though here little more than a cursing of
the event, is an echo of an old proverb, male parta male dilabuntur.
dum . . . eredunt: best got by an English present participle3 cf.

3 ξ 3. quacumque: used = quavis, while early Latin felt it
to be a relative requiring a relative clause after it.
ξ 12. an: cf. above, ξ 5. difficile fuit: strict syntax would

require ficisset, but Livy here treats the phrase as in all Latin such
auxiliary verbs as possum were treated; cf. 2 ξ 15. Latin, how-

ever, regularly followed logie in such phrases, e. g. longum est
dicere = ‘it would be a long story '. senes: the plural is
