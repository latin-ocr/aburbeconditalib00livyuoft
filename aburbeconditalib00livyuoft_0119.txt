AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 38-40

comitia centuriata and tributa arose and held the reality of power,
the formal vesting with imperium of those by them elected was done
by the ancient patrician comitia curiata. principium: in the
various curiae the votes were taken simultaneously; then the order
in which the results from the several curiae should be announced
was determined by lot, that which came first being called prin-
cipium. eiusdem euriae fuerat: in 390 and in 321 B. C. this
curia had been drawn first, when the lex curiata was to be passed
for the various magistrates of those years.

ξ 16. ad. Cremeram: a stream near Veii where 300 Fabii were
slain by an ambush, 477 13.C. facit: in his history.

CHAPTER XXXIX

ξ 1. auspiciis : i. e. for another comitia curiata to pass the lex.
ad terrorem, ‘at,’ ‘ on ’ ς cf. 22 ξ 7 ; defined by traducti . . . exer-
citus. nuper scriptis : as a reserve army in case Fabius'
march ended in disaster (37 ξ 11, 38 ξ 8).

Q· 7. nihil . . . movetur fugae, ‘ no (hint of) flight was attempted.²

§8. per . . . evaserint, ‘made their way over‚' to fill up the
gaps in the triarii now in the line. This aorist sequence is com-
moner than the imperfect even in Cicero, when the clause is
negative; but Cicero does not use it, as Livy does here, in an
affirmative clause. It is believed to be an attempt to represent
the Greek ὥστε with an aorist infinitive.

wea .

thought a pluperfect more logical.

§a fastigio aequali: a descriptive ablative (not aster latius).
cuneatior : sc. forma. The word is used by poets before Livy.
