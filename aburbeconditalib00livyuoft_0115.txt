AB vRBE CONDITA ΜΒ. IX. 33, 34

quod postremum iussisset, id: one of the laws in the Twelve
Tables (34 § 6). For the tense cf. 14 ξ 1. ius ratumque:
together, as the predicate to esset. non . . . teneri . . .
potuisse: the negative can be separated from the verb possum
when it is thrown forward so as to affect at once the whole sen-
tence. post . . . latam: Appius' argument seems to be that
the people in nominating censors subsequently to the Aemilian
law and not expressly limiting their powers (cf. 34 ξ ΙΙ) ipso scuto
repealed that law so sar as those censors were concerned.

CHAPTER XXXIV

ᾗ 1. inquit: sc. P. Sempronius.

32. ante . . . quam obruerent: the subjunctive as in 29§ 1.

ᾖξ’). Saerum montem: when Menenius Agrippa persuaded
them to return (see Shakespeare’s Coriolanus) 494 B. C.

§4 duo exereitus: in apposition to the subject. This was in
449 when the Decemvirs were put down. faenebres: this led
to the secession in 494. agrarias ε as to the disposal of the
‘ common lands ', at the same dates.

ᾖ 5. nomen, ‘family'; cf. 29 ξ 11.

§6 itane tandem? ‘Really?' An indignant question, where
landem = ‘pray '. eum, ‘ although.’ duodecim
tabulas: since Appius' contention claimed to be a true, though
novel, inference from the rule quoted in the next sentence,
Sempronius appeals against it to the improbability that the true
sense had hitherto escaped men. The XII Tables were drawn up
451 Β. C. iussisset: this sequence, in contrast to that in sil,
fiterz'nt above, is probably clue to a wish for variety ; Introd. p. 11.

spiitf the only perfect used by Livy, who uses scivi for the perfect
o sczsco.

§9 quid . . . mali: together. ira finitae potestatis:
ef. sor the sense 33 ξ 4. The genitive is objective‚ and gives the
cause of the annoyance. aerarium: a proletarian without vote.

ξ 19. auspiciis: instrumental or sociative (ablative) of attend-

} 11. utqui optimo iure . . . : part of the old formula used in
the lex directing the appointment of magistrates. It was intended
to secure to the new magistrates all the rights of their office : each
was to be appointed ‘as one who with fullest powers, with complete .
right, has (creatus est) been appointed '. After the dictatorship
was made liable to an appeal to the people this formula was
omitted in appointing dictators, on the ground that their powers were
less than those of earlier dictators. Had the same change been made
for the censorship, Ap. Claudius would have had no handle for his
argument. hoe . . . singulare, ‘this peculiar privilege!

If Claudius' reasoning holds, other magistrates might argue that the
