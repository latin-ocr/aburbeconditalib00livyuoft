ξ 10⁷ ‘ he felt easy!

nothing, support sitting still.' nihil = nou.

tive, since it is virtually suboblique—an idea in the general’s mind.

after incertos ; cf. 32 ξ 3. C icero writes, as a rule, victine an victores.

this Greek use 20 ξ 1. si . . . velint . . . eunt: the

irregularity in the condition corresponds with the sense.
