ξ 7. Suessa: where colonies are sent to sites not then occupied
generally the name is put in the nominative in apposition to coloniam
where to existing towns the accus. is used, as Interamnam below.

ξ 8. et =etiam. Observe the words thrown before ut for
emphasis, and so to effect a connexion with the previous sentence
without using a connective particle. senati = senalus ; cf.
plebei =plebis. sed: instead of the consuls in the year of the
decree carrying it out.

agreeing with res, which has the same sense as rei just before.

de . . . agitat, ‘think of.’ quieturus 2 for this use of the

Greek participle with ἅν, but influenced by the Latin use to represent
in Oratio Obliqua the conditional subjunctive, cf. Introd. p. 11.
ultro : of something unprovoked 3 ‘ taking the offensive.’ in-
ferrent : virtually suboblique‚ for the future indicative.
