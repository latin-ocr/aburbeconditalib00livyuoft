AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 18, 19

was so· felt to express a single noun-idea that it could govern
a genitive.

ξ 10. saecula: not ‘centuries' but ‘ generations’,three of which
are reckoned to a century. From the founding of Rome in 753 to
the death of Alexander in 323 we have 430 years, practically
thirteen generations.

ξ 1 1. qu‘m tu . . . confers: equivalent to an imperative3 a lively
way of putting a protasis (si confers). Cf. 10 ξ 7. oum ho-
mine: this ‘brachylogy of comparison ⁷ (comparatio compendiaria)
is due to the same motive as has been noticed in §9 rebus. Cf.
ubi non Hymetto Mella decedunt viridique certat Baca Venafro,
Horace, Od. ii. 6. 14 sqq.

ξ 12. nominem = ‘ could 1’ (if necessary). annalibus:
libri lintei kept in Juno Moneta's temple on the Capitol, giving
lists of magistrates. fastis: almost equally bald chronicles
kept by the pontifices, and recording the dates of battles‚ eclipses,
triumphs, and the like. consulum dictatorumque: not in
apposition to magistratuum, but with paginas = ‘ whole pages of',
‘ pages full of the names of.'

ξ 13. quo sint mirabiliores ε Livy does not notice that this
point may be pressed the other way-these magistrates’ short
office made possible their claim to unchequered success. vice-
nosque: the Roman mind found this logical, the English thinks
‘ 07* twenty' is so; cf. ξ 19 below.

ᾗ 14. tempus: cf. in tempore.

’ς 15. alterius: for the genitive cf. ξ 9 above. successum
est: for the impersonal passive cf. 14 ξ 16.

ξ 16. at hercule, ‘on the other hand’3 cf. 4 ξ 12. This is
probably a recollection of Demosthenes.

ξ 17. fortunae pignora: i. e. his previous successes, which were
an earnest of further success. .

ξ 19. vel . . . vel: not the same as aut . . . aut3 cf. 4 ξ 10.
rerum, ‘ achievements.’ quorum . . . viveret: consecu-

tive, hence not vixisset.
CHAPTER XIX

§2 lustris: the censors (and before them the consuls) every
five years took a census of the people, and before laying down their
office performed certain rites of purification for them. It is notice-
able that Livy had access to the tabulae censoriae of that time,
though he does not record the figures each lustrum ; cf. Introd. p. 7.
omni ε i. e. when all the Latins were in revolt3 cf. ξ 4. urbano
prope: apart srom the Latins, the Roman forces were almost
entirely drawn from Rome itself. dilectu: instrumental case,
giving the manner or circumstances of the levy. ξ 3. quaterni
quinique : this number of legions fought in each of the two
great seats of fighting at that time, viz, (1) the north, i. e. Etruria,
