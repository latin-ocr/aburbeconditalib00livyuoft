CHAPTER XXIV

§2 neo . . . et: cf. οὔτε . . . τε; and 4 ξ 8. tempore
longinqua . . . praeceps periculo : the language is rather
strained for conciseness and point. With a long siege victory was
distant ; a storm would be quicker, but dangerous and rash. The
chiasmus is to be noticed.

ξ 4. inde . . . perpulit: cf. 21 ξ 4 for the temporal use of the par-
ticle. ut by its position makes the grouping of the other words
clear, dividing the attributes of the subject from the predicate.

oblique statement after oblique request cf. 2 ᾗ 3. ardua, ‘ steep
ground, path.' pluribus . . . conlatis: see Introd. pp. 11 and 14.

ᾇ 14. infandae, ‘abominable‚ atrocious.'

§15. ouius . . . intererat: this construction was developed
under the infiuence of the almost synonymous refert. The reader
should turn to 9 ξ 7 for an account of the construction following
reffert, and should observe that with interest the construction
cannot be rigorously analysed and construed.

attendant circumstances = ‘in the course of ⁷ ; cf. 3 ᾗ 11 per-
