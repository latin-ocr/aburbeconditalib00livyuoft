AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 8, 9

may be used = ὅμως no less than μέντοι ; cf. the use of at below, ξ 8.
Thus qua = sed ea. Latin writers, however, have examples of
a construction like that used by Addison and some loose writers
to-day: e. g. ‘I have witnessed similar phenomena, and which
I will explain '. ex ea: under the contract. debentur: the
number is affected illogically but naturally by corpora, which
is nearer than the subject, · cs. by way of contrast, ‘l’ve found him
to be one cgf those men (= the sort of man) who doesn't hesilale to
break lus wmd, zs thew' s somellzzng togam by zt!

§7. placet, ‘J move, proposse? neo, ‘but not’3 cf. 7 ξ 9.
in: in regard to.

ξ 8. quaeso: an archaic use; Ciceronian Latin hardly used it
except parenthetically (= please). fuit : the sentence is con-
structed so as not to depend on precor quaesoque, otherwise the
mood would be different. at, ‘yet,' begins the apodosis‚ after
the if-clauses; cf. 1 ξ 8.

§9. habeatis: optative, like veli‘tzs below videre: this
is still to come. capitibus. instrumental; cf. 3 ξ 4.

ξ 10. ante nos consules: cf. ab urbe condita, 3 ξ 13.

ξ 11. modo . . . modo: according as admiration or pity was
up ermost.

ξ 12. iram . . ,pacisz the enemies’ rage at.

§.13 modo: they did not discuss the proposal, but confined
themselves to eulogy of Postumius. pedibus irent: the
senate voted by an actual division (di'scesszo), not by cries of ‘ Aye ’
and ‘ No ’, nor by show of hands. tribunis plebis: now
ten in number.

ξ 14. sua = an objective genitive. fuissent, restituerentur :
oblique in historic sequence for suerum, restz'tuenlzcr3 cf. 2 ξ 5.

§ 15. pro eo, quod: together. meritos esse . . . posse:
observe the difference in sense expressed by the tense.

CHAPTER IX

ξ 1. dedetis, ‘you shall . . .‚' perhaps as often with a jussive
sense. et =eliam3 cf. 2 4. istos: osten with some
contempt or dislike3 cf. istam, 5 below.
¹ ξ 2. audiatis: the future would have brought the flogging into
line with the surrender, as equally certain future events; the
change of mood makes the flogging a possible addition only ; so
dedantur. iam, ‘ at once,' ‘ immediately ’ ; cf. the use of ἤδη.

§3. quod . . . negant: for English quod (which is a develop-
ment of the adverbial ace.= ‘as to the fact that') should be

omitted, and the clause made a separate sentence. dicere:
pependerit on zjgnorel. iuris fetialium : nearly ‘ international
aw .

ξ 4. infitias eo: one of the few phrases in Classical Latin which,
without containing the name of a town, &c.‚ retain the accusative
