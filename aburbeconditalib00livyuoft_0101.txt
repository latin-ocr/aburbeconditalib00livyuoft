was turned ⁹, Introd. p. 15. Samnis: cf. 2 ξ 5 sor the
singular.

ξ 10. quaestione, ‘ inquiry' ; almost technical‚ cf. quaestio fier-
petua. quos: for the antecedent omitted cf. 15 ξ 3 and below
scribunt, qui.

ξ 11. inde: presumably if Cursor was not consul then, he was
in his namesake's army. ad triumphum: on 21 August
(of the Roman calendar) 320 Β. C. decessisse ε technical, of

a commander leaving his province to come home. auctores
sunt takes the construction that might follow scribunt.

ξ 12. et, ‘ and in fact ’ ; we might use ‘ He was a man indeed ³.

ξ 13. eundem, as often to an English mind, merely connects,
as if = ‘and also ’.

ξ 14. eum, ‘under the command of’: cf. 13 ξ 6. ullo: the
regular ablative from quisquam 3 cf. 2 ξ 10.

ξ 15. etiam introduces a fact confirmatory of the last state-
ment ; cf. et just above.

ξ 16. ille . . . inquit: Livy not unnaturally finds it convenient
to drop the construction after ferunt, and to adopt direct speech
again. utique, ‘at any rate, at least.' dorsum: i. e. of
the horses. vis . . . imperii ingens . . . in, ‘ a commanding
influence over.5

ξ 17. praetor: the presiding magistrate of Praeneste, who

the Roman forces,

ξ 18. multa. (dieta) τ not the adjective.

p. 13. staret: the subjunctive regularly follows such a phrase
as nemo eral qui. destinant animis: together. si . . .
vertisset: the apodosis is contained in parem . . . ducem, which
= ‘as the man who would have been ’. In Greek, which has
a participle of εἰμι’ (= sum) and which can attach (Ἰν 10 a participle,
this sense can be tersely expressed by ἂν ὄντα. Latin writers of
this date wished to secure an equally terse form of expression in
their own language, and resorted to the turn used here by Livy.

CHAPTER XVII

ξ 1. quaesitum, sc. ‘by me’. No one could think Livy had so
sar travelled outside his subject. The history of Rome was in itself
interesting enough and full enough of chequered episodes and
dramatic soenes, to need no interludes. plus iusto, ‘mz-
necessarily! varietatibus, ‘ digressions.’ et legentibus . . .
et . . . meo: observe the chiasmus.

ξ 2. quibus . . . volutavi animum: English (and Latin gene-
