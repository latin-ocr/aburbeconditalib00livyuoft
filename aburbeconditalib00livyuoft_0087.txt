AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 4

CHAPTER IV

ξ 1. in eastris: in strictly logical sense goes with rerum inopia
esset. The grammar of logie, however, is not with good writers the
final test. For similar illogicality preferred for conciseness cf. ‘ We
do not presume to come to this Thy table, O Lord, trusting in our
own righteousness, but (we come trusting) in Thy manifold and great
mercies '. rerum inopia: an abstract noun, if rerum is
added to it, is frequently used, in all Latin, correspondently to our
use of such words.

ς’ 2. primum : μάλιστα μέν, ‘if possible.' peterent : for
the sequence cf. 2 ξ 9. uti: convenience dictates the change
from qui ; cf. 1 ἕξ 3 and 9.

ξ 3. seirent: with the infinitive = ⁴ know how to '. missu-
rum: without esse, as originally, when it was an indeclinable form,
not confused with the future participle ; cf. victurum below.
alias: than the first, stated in the previous sentence.

§4 decederetur: we should use an active verb3 cf. z'tzcr in
antiquam silvam (= they go). For the mood and tense cf. 2 ξ 5
ferret ; but it is regular in all Latin in conditional clauses in reported
speech. coloniae: the Roman military posts in a conquered
country, which served the same end as William the Conqueror’s
castles. suis legibus: i. e. each nation under its own. The
pronoun does not here refer to the speaker.

ξ 5. ferire: the metaphorical use with foedus arose from the fact
that to ratify a treaty a swine was slain ; cf. 5 ἓξ 1, 3. displiceat: ε
observe the sudden change of sequence, the more remarkable since
vetuit is added.

ᾗ 6. gravius: cf. graviter ferre. accepturi . . . si
nuntiaretur : a conditional sentence which in direct speech would
take the subjunctive will, if so constructed that either the subjunc-
tive for yet another reason would be required or the main clause
must be in the infinitive, change its form so that the future participle
gives the hypothetica] tinge. Here, it might have been said at the
time non gravius acciperent, sz' nuntiaretur. (This explains why
the imperfect not pluperfect follows si.) Livy puts this to follow
viderentur, so that we have accepturi (esse).

ς’ 7. tum, ‘at last? princeps, ‘the first amongst.'
honoribus : the offices he had held.

ξ 8. in capitolio: where a remnant of Romans, it was
patriotically represented, held out against the Gauls after they had
captured Rome, 390 B.C. non fuisse auctorem: closely
together ‘opposed the proposal', ‘recommended the senate not ⁹.
civitatis ··= ctvz'um3 it is not the same in meaning as res publica.
nec . . . et: the ol'd Latin negative was ne. Soin Greek οὔτε . . .
τε often occurs. ad . . . muniendum: being enclosed
between the adjective (tgnavissimo) and its noun qualifies the
