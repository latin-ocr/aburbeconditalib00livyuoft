AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 2, 3

ξ 7. saltus, ‘ passes,’ ‘defilesss cirea : Livy frequently puts
an adverb between a noun and an agreeing adjective, and makes it
express another adjective meaning. The use is like that in Greek
osan adverb with the article to give an adjectival sense. Here the
sense is ‘ which lay around ’. satis, ‘ fairly‚' ‘ rather.’

ξ 8. antequam venias: the subjunctive, to give the prospective
sense, ‘ before the traveller can come.’ The second person in Latin
osan imagined character is not familiar, as the corresponding use
is in English. Older English writers use ‘a man ’ for ‘one ’.
eadem, like qud here and in ξ 5, is in use an adverb, in origin a
pronoun agreeing with via understood. insinuaveris: Latin
uses this precise tense, where English uses a present or aorist.
pergas: the subjunctive makes this alternative the vaguer and less

prgbgbffia alia: opposed to the following alias angustias.
in eum campum . . . demisso: together.

ξ 10. sua: as the pass in front also had its obex. ullius:
used as the genitive of quisquam 3 so ullo, ξ 13.

ἓ 11. magis: than himself.

. 12. operi: i. e. of sortifying a camp (muniendz'); cf. 19 §9.
fore ε for the subject omitted see 1 § 11.

§ 13. culpam: of their own )( the doing of fortune. propter:
with its poetical meaning, of position.

ξ 14. confessione: sc. that it was vain.

ξ 15. consilium: a Council ofVVar. consilio . . . locus:
there was no possibility of planning any deliverance‚ no way of
escape could possibly be thought of. esset: by the mood
used Livy gives the sense that this was in the consuls' thoughts.
For this vz‘rtually suboblique use cf. 5 ξ 6. legati, ‘com-
manders of divisions.’ tribuni: sc. militum. praetorium ε
one of the two praetoria of ξ 12, in which the council was held.
poterant: as usual with this auxiliary verb the indicative is used
where we should have thought the writer might use the subjunctive.
(That mood Livy avoids, since it would have suggested the same
sense as we have in esset, just above.) The sense is ‘ would have
been able ’.

CHAPTER III

ξ 1. pro ingenio quisque: some temperaments being melan·
choly and despondent, some sanguine. adversa montium:
a poetical turn3 cf. strata viarum, opaca iugorum.

ξ 2. modo = dummodo. vincimus 2 the present with iam,
as a VVelshman or Irishman says ‘it hasn’t rained since you are
lzere' (= you have been here). So with iamdudum, iampridem.
perfidum: so petfide Albion, Punica fides, and the implication
in ‘ Dutch courage '.

ξ 3. eamus: a good example of how the deliberative subjunctive
