AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 35, 36

CHAPTER XXXV

ξ 1. ducenti: without an object; cf. superas, 32 ξ 7. muni-
tiones : i. e. the beleaguering lines.
ξ 2. subiecta: below the hills, which Fabius had just descended.
4. ingerere: a poetical turn; Introd. p. 11.
ξς. scuta . . . ictae: cf. 27 ξ 13 audita, etc. ; for conciseness
this is left to be the grammatical subject of vulneraverant.
§7. per obliqua campi, ‘ diagonally across the plain ’3 cf. 37

ξ 1 for this poetical neuter plural. petunt: equites Romani ’

is subject to the subordinate verb only, so that the main subject
remains unchanged.

CHAPTER XXXVI
ξ 1. Germanici saltus: Caesar's conquests from 58 B.c. onwards

had opened up this region. nulli: cf. the dative with the
gerundive. It gives properly the person interested rather than the
agent. diem, ‘ time, hour‚' not ‘ day’, and therefore feminine.

audebat: i. e. at first ()( tum below) ‘ had the heart to, was bold
to ’ ; almost in its old sense ‘was eager to ’.

§a Caesonem: these writers merely differed as to the prae-
nomen3 yet others thought him a half-brother of the consul.
consulem: attracted to the case of C. Claudium . . . genitum.

ξ 3. Caere: cf. rure. hospites: Etruscan friends of his
family. auctores: sc. ‘wlco state that . . .' litteris : Cicero
declares that the Etruscans gave Rome her science of augury.

ξ 4. propius vero: together. praecipuum aliquid : i. e.
some special knowledge of Etruscan. qui . . . immiscuerit:
probably a caused sense is in the pronoun.

ξς. ne . . . possent, ‘to save them from being found out.'
qua . . . insigni nota, ‘any noticeable blemish‚' ‘any glaring
sign, instance ² (of defective knowledge, of ignorance).

ξ 6. abhorrebat ab fide: the subject is the following clause, in
which quemquam is due to the negative implication of this
predicate.

§7. (consulis) verbis, ‘in the name, on behalf of . . .
egisse : from dicuntur we must supply dicitur or the like.

ξ 8. iussum: sc. esse. paratam imperio: together3
imperio not ablative.
ξ 10. saltum: cf. ξ 14 below. ξ 11. emittit: i.e. to plunder.
12. praedarum: of several raiding parties. praedae:
predicative dative. fuerint: cf. for this aorist 32 ξ Ι2.

ξ 14. forte, like τυγχάνω in Greek, gives a sense not properly
represented by the English ‘ by chance ’ or ‘ happened ⁵. It draws
attention to the coincidence in time, and is something like ‘just at
that moment ’. serius : the comparative is never used except
when its meaning is extended by such an addition as here. Sero =
