AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 5, 6

foedus is due to a belief that the Roman subsequent victory proved
that there was no offence against the gods on the Romans' part.

ξ 3. esset: the condition implied is virtually contained in the
words in foedere (= si foedus esset). For the tense (not pluperfect)
cf. 4§ 6. Contrast below si . . . acta res esset, . . . exstarent.
ubi = in quo, following foedere. per quem: the antecedent
is (ut) eum (sc. populum) (luppiter feriat). fiat: suboblique
forfiet‚ 4 ξ 4, and below staretur. quo minus z here follows
fiat, which suggests ‘impediments shall be caused ’. legibus:
the case as 11 ξ 2. ut : the substance of the prayer3 cf. 4 §2.

ξ 4. quaestores: the paymasters‚ young men who were specially
under the consuls' care, and attached to his staff. ubi,
‘ whereas.'

§6. deducti essent: virtually suboblique3 i.e. the mood con-
veys the men's reflections; cf. 2 ξ 15.

ς’ 7. fuisse-1 not esse, which would be used of time contempo—
raneous witlz tlte prz'nczpczl verb 3 cf. 19 ξ 10. modo: cf. quo
modo.

ξ 8. intueri: an example of what is called the historic infinz'lz’ve,
where the writer hits off a picture with rapid strokes without
troubling to inflect the verb. The effect is not unlike that of
Mr. Alfred Jingle's telegraphic style, and it is used either for vivid
descriptions or for rapid narrative. The subject is in the nomina-
tive (ipsi, below).

ξ 9. sociorum: see the map for the route taken. parentes:
the men in the armies would be from 17 to 46 years old. In Greek
and Latin the district is mentioned first (here patriam), and then the
particular place to which motion takes place. Cf. the German mode
of addressing a letter. quo: i. e. to their country and their
parents. Logically the addition of maiores is a little loose, and so
is eornm grammatically3 contrast se directly after.

ξ 10. animos, ‘courage.’

ξ 11. hora fatalis: poetical; Introd. p. 11. tristiora: 6 ξ 3.
factura: a poetical use of the future participle3 Introd. p. 1 1.

ξ 12. iam primum . . . tum are parallel; cf. for iam 16 §L
primi: before anything was done in regard to the others.

ξ 13. a consulibus: not the ablative of the agent; cf. 3 § 13.
ipsos: sc. eos. eos: sc. the consuls. exsecrantes agrees
with the subject of censuerant.

CHAPTER VI

ξ 1. ita: in that order were tlzey sent under the yoke, not so the
more z'nsults were lzeaped on them. deinceps singulae : i. e. a
legion at a time.

ξ 2. plerisque: Livy uses this word, as writers later than he did,
to mean ‘many' not ‘most’. ei . ; . offendisset: this use
of the subjunctive is copied from the Greek optative of indefinite
