AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 14, 15

occursare: the historic infinitive in giving a rapid impressionist
icture; cf. 5 ς’ 8.

p ξ 4. auctoribus dis: cf. Nil desperandmtc Teucro duce et

auspice Teucro, Hor. Od. i. 7. rem gerendam: often tech-

nically of battle ; cf. our ‘engagement '.

ξ 5. ferri, ‘advanced‚ carried forward.’ aliis modum
. . . faeere, ‘ limit others’ (liberty to make) peace or war ' 3 ‘ dictate
to others when they should make peace ³. aequum censeret:
together; ‘claimed‚ ⁴ presumed.' For the mood in a virtually sub-
oblique clause cf. 2 § 15.

§6 aut . . . aut: the two possible reasons are thrown more
into opposition as distinct and mutually exclusive things than they
would have been if vel . . . vel had been used ; cf. 12 ξ 2.

§ 7. vociferari: cf. occursare, ξ 3. potius always implies
choice and preference in the subject of the verb. ferat . . .
videantur: for the ‘vivid' primary sequence cf. 7 ξ 5, 12 §2
ut follows passuros: contrast ξ 16, where the subjunctive without
ut follows.

ξ 9. pars, with a plural verb, as often, by the natural influence
of the sense3 cf. our use with ‘crowd ’. neo . . . modo = et
non mod0; cf. 3 § 9.

ξ 10. haec: not attracted, since the three predicates are of
different genders. vicisset: for the rnood in the suboblique
clause cf. arcerent just below and tenerentur, ξ 14.

ξ 12. ullum ; contrast cuiquam militum, ᾗ 13.

ξ 13. itaque: since they had called the soldiers back. dulce-
dinem irae: cf. ⁶ revenge is sweet '. odio: ablative 3 ‘in . . . '

ξ 14. futuros fuisse, ni . . . praepedisset: the oblique form,
in which the future participle is regularly used to represent a
potential clause needing the subjunctive in the direct form3 cf.

ἐξ 15. desperata venia: cf. interiecla regio, 13 ξ 8.

ᾖ 16. laudare: cf. ξ 7 voczserari. obviam itum . . . esse:
cf. for this impersonal passive use 13 ξ 1.

CHAPTER XV

ξ 1. consilium, ‘ a Council of War . . . (to consz'der).' altero
. . . duce: the instrumental (without ab) is proper with exercitu
(cf. 13 ξ 10), and this carries duce with it here. Apuli eirca
= οἱ πέριξ; cf. 2 ξ 7, Introd. p. 11. ad id, ‘ up to that time)

2. aliquot . . . populos: ‘ a considerable number of . . .’

3. Luceriae: locative. restiterat: not from resisto.
qui . . . erant: sc, eos, as object to (legatos) misere. essent:
probably the mood follows that of absz‘steret; cf. 1 ξ 9, but it may
be an example of a virtually suboblique clause.

ξ 4. debuisse : not debere, which would refer to a time contem-
porary with the principal verb.
