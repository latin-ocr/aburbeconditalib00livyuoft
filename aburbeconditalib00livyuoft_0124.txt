AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 46

ᾗ 10. ceterum carries the reader back to ξ 1, after the digres-
sion. forensis factio: this would include mechanics, artisans‚
δια, who, having no landed property, were counted with proletarii,
and were capite censi, voting at the comitia centuriata in the last
century. They were probably without any vote in the comitia
tributa until this time. The effect of Appius' innovation was
similar to that of our own Reform Bilis passed in 1867 and 1884.
primus: in Caesarian times the same promotion of freedmen was
seen. libertinorum must here mean ‘ freed-slaves ' ; libertinis
in its general use would include the sons of such men, but they
are here distinguished from thern. It was the custom to expect,
even for a knight's rank, a freeman’s status in the knight himself, in
his father, and in his grandfather. But no law had specifically stated
that this was a sine qua non, and Appius, in the absence of such
a law, acted on the general instructions of the lex Ovinia ( 30 ξ 1).
So in the English Constitution no law, it has been said, has
specifically withdrawn from women the right to vote at the election
of Members of Parliament.

ξ 11. habuit, ‘ regarded, treated as.' adeptus erat: the
plu erfect gives the sense, ‘he found that he had secured’; cf.
45 6. per· omnes tribus : he allowed them to select any
tribe they liked, and put them on the list of voters from that tribe.
forum ε where the comitia tributa met. eampum: where
the comitia centuriata met. Once these men were members of
a tribe (the more ancient and exclusive comitia voting by tribes)
they began to vote in the centuries (more recently instituted and
less exclusive), not amongst the proletarii, but in that one of the
five classes to which their property entitled them to belong.

ᾗ 12. Flavii comitia, ‘ the comitia at which Flavius was elected ;
his election.’ habuerunt, ‘ occasioned)

ξ 13, bonorum: masculine. aliud . . . tendebat: an
example of the common development in language by which an
originally intransitive verb becomes transitive. In this word the
construction is first found in poetry.

ξ 14. excretam: a Vergilian word. urbanas: previously
not specially distinguished from the rusticae tribus. Henceforward
they were of less importance than the others, their large numbers
for one thing making the individua] vote in them less weighty than
that in the country tribes. So an Irish vote is worth more than
a vote in many English constituencies.

ξ 15. acceptam (sc. esse): not the adjective here, but the verb,
so that animis is not dative. transveherentur: the trans-
vectio equitum was from the temple of Honos before the porta
Capena through the sorum to the Capitol. The knights wore the
trabea and any badges of honour they had won in war. It was
only in every fifth year at the census that there was a recognitio
equitum.
