reason to think that there really were concluded (1) a treaty in
509 B.C., (2) one before the subjugation of Latium 339, not men-

CHAPTER XLIV

3. Piso: one of Livy's authorities.
4. memoria fugerit: sc. eum. binos: not duo.

Q 12. fugam quoque : no less than fighting and conquering.

§3 pacemne: cf. 23 §4 for this Livian use, so distinct from
Cicero’s.

ξ 6. postquam . . . venerant : for the effect of this tense

ξ 8. legendi = elzjgendi, almost sayz'ng (their preference), hence

the sound of a general rule.

ξ 10. suo nomine )( such proceedings as in §sabove per· .

tive ; cf. 22 ξ 3 securim- agere.
